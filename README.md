## Privacy

Documents are encrypted with AES256-GCM, with the key being created from a user supplied password or a randomly
generated 224bit value that is passed in the URL. 

The password or key is passed through a KDF (key derivation function, or key stretching function) with a unique salt to make brute force attacks impractical. The KDF used is `PBKDF2(scrypt(PASSWORD))` with R=2^15, P=3 for scrypt and 250,000 iterations of PBKDF2
 
**All encryption and decryption is done client side in the browser** Your password or content never leaves your machine and only encrypted data is transmitted over the network to be stored or retrieved by the Arweave blockchain

**IMPORTANT**: This makes brute-forcing passwords difficult, but trivial passwords like 12345 or common phrases could still be cracked easily, so **make sure to use a strong & unique password**

For scrypt we select the scrypt-async npm library, due it having zero dependencies, being quite widely used, and documented clearly for browser use.
