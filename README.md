## PermaPaste 

Store plain text ascii documents, markdown documents on the Arweave Permaweb. Store pastes publicy or encrypted, using a password or secret link to encrypt the page. 

You do not need your private wallet key to open previously encrypted pastes, only the tx id (url) and passphrase.

Other features

- Permaweb App so the version you use now will always be available. 
- Lightweight & Mobile friendly
- Supports GitHub flavour Markdown (v0.29) 
- Recover and edit previous pastes by searching by wallet address or block number
- Use as mobile app (PWA), pick the Add to Home screen option from your mobile browser (tested in Mobile Firefox & Mobile Chrome)

## Use cases 

- Publish public pastes & documents
- Private notepad
- Private sharing of pastes & documents  
- Publish ascii art, e-zines or other ascii based content on the Arweave blockchain

## Potential Future Features & Improvments

- Provide instructions on reproducible build / verifying deployed version matches the GitHub sources
- Some form of bookmarking password protected documents to allow them to be looked up easier 
- Publish Mode, publish previously saved documents.
  - Render to HTML and publish as stand-alone web page
  - Potentially publish to other arweave apps such as Scribe, Weavez, AskWeave etc. This wouldnt require any integration on       their side but would need additional tags/metadata etc added depending on the app.
- Improve editor to insert markdown snippets for tables etc.
- Add support for more markdown extensions such as charts, uml diagrams, etc.
- More content types supported 
- Password strength checking, heuristic and against haveibeenpwned database.
- File attachments
- Re-introduce hightlight.js and support code snippets more explicitly
- Insert file into editor. Insert text file as editor content, auto select format
- Use a wasm module for scrypt to decrease encrypt/decrypt time.


## Privacy

Documents are encrypted with AES256-GCM, with the key being created from a user supplied password or a randomly
generated 224bit value that is passed in the URL. 

The password or key is passed through a KDF (key derivation function, or key stretching function) with a unique salt to make brute force attacks impractical. The KDF used is `PBKDF2(scrypt(PASSWORD))` with R=2^16, P=2 for scrypt and 250,000 iterations of PBKDF2. 

The KDF and parameters were selected after consulting https://keybase.io/warp/ & https://blog.filippo.io/the-scrypt-parameters/   

**All encryption and decryption is done client side in the browser** Your password or content never leaves your machine and only encrypted data is transmitted over the network to be stored or retrieved by the Arweave blockchain

**IMPORTANT**: This makes brute-forcing passwords difficult, but trivial passwords like 12345 or common phrases could still be cracked easily, so **make sure to use a strong & unique password**

For scrypt we select the scrypt-async npm library, due it having zero dependencies, being quite widely used, and documented clearly for browser use.

## Development

Built with Vue & Parcel Bundler

To run dev-mode with live-reload: 

`npm run dev` 
or 
`npm run dev-lan` to run with https so usable from lan clients. This breaks firefox live-reload.

To build for production:

`npm run build`
